hello! this is a website using [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) to showcase a random artist based on the genre you choose.

# some struggles:
Since this is my first React project and also my first time using the Spotify API, there were a few problems I encountered while trying to figure out the API, particularly attempting to use the search method to get artists based on the selected genre. I think for the future I would like to expand upon this project, and come up with a better and more accurate way of searching for and finding recommendations via the API.
